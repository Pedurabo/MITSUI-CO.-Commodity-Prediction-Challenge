## 📈 Iteration Strategy

### Week 1: Baseline
- [ ] Submit first entry
- [ ] Analyze leaderboard position
- [ ] Identify improvement areas

### Week 2: Optimization
- [ ] Try different feature sets
- [ ] Adjust model parameters
- [ ] Test different ensemble weights

### Week 3: Advanced Techniques
- [ ] Implement additional features
- [ ] Try different meta-models
- [ ] Optimize for competition metric

### Week 4: Final Polish

- [ ] Ensure reproducibility
- [ ] Complete documentation

## 🚨 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Runtime exceeded"
**Solutions:**
- Reduce feature count to 400-500
- Use more conservative model parameters
- Limit cross-validation folds to 3

### Issue: "Memory exceeded"
**Solutions:**
- Use float32 instead of float64
- Reduce batch sizes
- Implement more aggressive garbage collection

### Issue: "Submission failed"
**Solutions:**
- Check for missing dependencies
- Verify all imports are available
- Test notebook from clean environment

### Issue: "Poor performance"
**Solutions:**
- Try different feature selection methods
- Adjust ensemble weights
- Add more domain-specific features
