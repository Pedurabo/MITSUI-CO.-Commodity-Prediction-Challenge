2. **Run the notebook:**
   - Click "Run All" to execute the entire notebook
   - Wait for completion (should be < 8 hours)
   - The notebook will generate `submission.csv`

3. **Submit:**
   - Click "Submit" button
   - Add a description: "First submission - Memory-efficient LightGBM with feature selection"
   - Confirm submission

#### Option B: Direct File Upload
1. **Prepare submission file:**
   - Use `outputs/competition_submission.csv`
   - Ensure it has the correct format (date_id, target_0, target_1, etc.)

2. **Upload:**
   - Go to "Submissions" tab
   - Click "Submit Predictions"
   - Upload your CSV file
   - Add description and submit

### Step 3: Submission Requirements Checklist

## 📊 Submission File Format

Your submission should look like this:

```csv
date_id,target_0,target_1,target_2,target_3
2023-01-01,-0.795738188655924,-0.6084743018575822,-0.13590205384240575,0.49025769022747595
2023-01-02,-0.3218510465038691,-0.6172046184328013,-0.10948434304675742,0.3491788462997239
...
```

**Requirements:**
- `date_id`: Test dates in YYYY-MM-DD format
- `target_X`: Predictions for each target (424 total in real competition)
- No missing values
- Numeric predictions (can be negative)

## 🎯 Competition Strategy

### First Submission Goals:
1. **Establish Baseline:** Get a working submission
2. **Validate Pipeline:** Ensure everything works correctly
3. **Check Compliance:** Verify runtime and memory limits
4. **Get Feedback:** See initial performance

### Iteration Strategy:
1. **Week 1:** Focus on getting a working submission
2. **Week 2:** Optimize for memory and runtime
3. **Week 3:** Improve model performance
4. **Week 4:** Advanced feature engineering
5. **Week 5-6:** Ensemble methods and tuning
6. **Week 7-8:** Final optimization and submission

## 🚨 Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: "Runtime exceeded"
**Solution:**
- Reduce feature count (use 500 instead of 1977)
- Use conservative model parameters
- Limit cross-validation during submission

### Issue: "Memory exceeded"
**Solution:**
- Use memory optimization functions
- Reduce data types (float32 instead of float64)
- Process in smaller batches

### Issue: "File format error"
**Solution:**
- Check column names match exactly
- Ensure no missing values
- Verify date format is correct

### Issue: "Submission failed"
**Solution:**
- Check for external API calls
- Ensure all dependencies are available
- Verify code runs without errors

## 📈 Performance Tracking

### Track These Metrics:
- **Public Score:** Visible during competition
- **Runtime:** Should be < 8 hours
