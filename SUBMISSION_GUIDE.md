# MITSUI&CO. Commodity Prediction Challenge - Submission Guide

## Overview
This guide provides three different submission approaches for the MITSUI competition, each with increasing complexity and potential performance.

## Submission Options

### 1. **Basic Submission** (`kaggle_submission_code.txt`)
**Best for:** Getting started, understanding the competition structure
- **Approach:** Uses lag values with minimal noise
- **Complexity:** Low
- **Expected Score:** ~11318101831830900.000 (baseline)
- **Pros:** Simple, fast, guaranteed to work
- **Cons:** Basic performance, no real modeling

### 2. **Improved Submission** (`kaggle_improved_submission.py`)
**Best for:** Better performance with real machine learning
- **Approach:** Uses LightGBM models trained on actual features
- **Complexity:** Medium
- **Expected Score:** Better than baseline
- **Pros:** Real machine learning, better performance
- **Cons:** Takes longer to train, more complex

### 3. **Ensemble Submission** (`kaggle_ensemble_submission.py`)
**Best for:** Maximum performance with model diversity
- **Approach:** Combines LightGBM, XGBoost, Random Forest, and Ridge
- **Complexity:** High
- **Expected Score:** Best performance
- **Pros:** Model diversity, robust predictions
- **Cons:** Slowest, most complex

### 4. **Advanced Submission** (`kaggle_advanced_submission.py`)
**Best for:** Sophisticated approach with feature engineering
- **Approach:** Feature engineering + optimized LightGBM
- **Complexity:** Very High
- **Expected Score:** Potentially best performance
- **Pros:** Advanced features, optimized models
- **Cons:** Most complex, may have memory issues

## How to Submit

## Expected Results

| Submission Type | Expected Score | Training Time | Complexity |
|----------------|----------------|---------------|------------|
| Basic | ~11318101831830900.000 | < 1 minute | Low |
| Improved | Better than baseline | 5-10 minutes | Medium |
| Ensemble | Best performance | 15-30 minutes | High |
| Advanced | Potentially best | 20-40 minutes | Very High |

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **Memory errors:** Use Basic or Improved submission
2. **Timeout errors:** Reduce model complexity
3. **Package errors:** Ensure all packages are installed

### Performance Tips:
1. **Start simple:** Begin with Basic submission
2. **Test locally:** Run code in development mode first
3. **Monitor resources:** Watch for memory/timeout issues
4. **Iterate:** Try different approaches and compare

## Next Steps for Improvement

### After Basic Submission Works:
1. **Feature Engineering:** Add rolling statistics, lag features
2. **Model Tuning:** Optimize hyperparameters
3. **Ensemble Methods:** Combine multiple models
4. **Cross-Validation:** Use proper validation strategies

### Advanced Techniques:
1. **Time Series Features:** Add seasonal, trend features
2. **Domain Knowledge:** Incorporate financial market insights
3. **Neural Networks:** Try deep learning approaches
4. **Meta-Learning:** Learn from multiple targets
