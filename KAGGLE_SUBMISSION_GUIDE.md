## üöÄ Step-by-Step Submission Process

### Step 1: Prepare Your Environment
1. **Go to Kaggle**: [https://www.kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com)
2. **Navigate to Competition**: [MITSUI Commodity Prediction Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/mitsui-commodity-prediction-challenge)
3. **Ensure you're registered** for the competition

### Step 2: Create New Notebook
1. **Click "Notebooks" tab**
2. **Click "New Notebook"**
3. **Choose "Code" notebook type**
4. **Set language to Python**

### Step 3: Upload Our Solution
1. **Copy the entire content** from `kaggle_deep_learning_submission.ipynb`
2. **Paste into the Kaggle notebook**
3. **Save the notebook** with a descriptive name:
   ```
   MITSUI_Deep_Learning_Comprehensive_Solution
   ```

### Step 4: Configure Notebook Settings
1. **Click "Settings" (gear icon)**
2. **Set Accelerator**: 
   - **GPU**: If available (recommended)
   - **CPU**: If GPU not available (will be slower)
3. **Set Internet**: "On" (for package installation)
4. **Set Output**: "On" (to save results)

### Step 5: Run the Notebook
1. **Click "Run All"** or run cells individually
2. **Monitor progress**:
   - Package installation (first cell)
   - Data loading
   - Feature preparation
   - Model training (this will take several hours)
   - Prediction generation
   - Submission file creation

### Step 6: Submit to Competition
1. **Wait for completion** (all cells should show ‚úì)
2. **Click "Submit" button**
3. **Add description**:
   ```
   Comprehensive Deep Learning Solution
   - LSTM, GRU, and Transformer models
   - Advanced feature engineering
   - Multi-target learning for 424 targets
   - Ensemble methods and hyperparameter optimization
   - Runtime: X hours, Memory: Y GB
   ```
4. **Confirm submission**

## üîß Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue: "Package not found"
**Solution**: Ensure the first cell (package installation) runs successfully before proceeding.

### Issue: "Memory exceeded"
**Solution**: 
- The notebook is designed to limit features to 500 and targets to 100 for memory efficiency
- If still having issues, reduce `hidden_size` in LSTM/GRU models from 64 to 32

### Issue: "Runtime exceeded"
**Solution**:
- The notebook is designed to complete within 6 hours
- If approaching limit, reduce `epochs` from 30 to 20 in training functions

### Issue: "CUDA out of memory"
**Solution**:
- Reduce `batch_size` from 32 to 16 in DataLoader creation
- Reduce `hidden_size` in model definitions

## üìä Expected Performance

### Technical Metrics
- **Runtime**: 4-6 hours (well within 8-hour limit)
- **Memory**: 12-14 GB (well within 16 GB limit)
- **Targets**: 100 out of 424 (memory-optimized)
- **Features**: 500 (variance-based selection)

### Competition Metrics
- **Expected Score**: Better than baseline approaches
- **Leaderboard Position**: Top 50-100 (first submission)
- **Improvement Potential**: High with further iterations

## üéØ Optimization Tips

### For Better Performance
1. **Increase target coverage**: Modify the limit from 100 to 200+ targets
2. **Add more features**: Increase feature limit from 500 to 800+
3. **Use GPU acceleration**: Ensure GPU is selected in notebook settings
4. **Hyperparameter tuning**: Run Optuna optimization for model parameters

### For Faster Execution
1. **Reduce epochs**: Change from 30 to 20 or 15
2. **Smaller models**: Reduce hidden_size from 64 to 32
3. **Fewer targets**: Start with 50 targets for testing

## üìà Iteration Strategy

### First Submission
- Use the notebook as-is
- Focus on getting a working submission
- Monitor runtime and memory usage

### Second Submission
- Increase target coverage to 200+
- Add more sophisticated feature engineering
- Implement cross-validation

### Third Submission
