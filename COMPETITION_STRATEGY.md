- Batch predictions
- Garbage collection
```

### 2. Runtime Optimization (CRITICAL)
```python
# Runtime optimization strategies
- Conservative model parameters
- Early stopping in gradient boosting

- Minimal cross-validation during submission
```

### 3. Overfitting Prevention (HIGH)
```python
# Overfitting prevention strategies
- Time-series CV with gaps
- Regularization (L1/L2)
- Feature sampling
- Data sampling
- Model ensemble diversity
```

### 4. Competition Metric Optimization (HIGH)
```python
# Sharpe ratio variant optimization
- Mean Spearman correlation / Standard deviation
- Focus on stability (lower variance)
- Multi-target performance
- Robust evaluation across time periods
```

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Memory-Efficient Pipeline
```python
# Key components
from src.memory_optimization import create_memory_efficient_pipeline
from src.robust_validation import time_series_cv_robust
from src.multi_target import parse_target_pairs

# Usage
train_opt, labels_opt, test_opt, features = create_memory_efficient_pipeline(
    train_df, train_labels, target_pairs, test_df,
    max_features=500,  # Conservative for runtime
    max_targets=None   # Use all targets
)
```

### Competition-Ready Submission
```bash
# Run competition submission
python run_competition_submission.py

# Or use notebook template
jupyter notebook notebooks/competition_submission_template.ipynb
```

## üèÖ Community Insights

### From Discussion Analysis
1. **Memory Management**: Major challenge (14 replies in "Reduce data size")
2. **Overfitting**: Significant concern (4 comments)
3. **Team Formation**: Active (multiple "Looking for team" posts)
4. **Getting Started**: Official Discord available

### Recommended Actions
1. **Download real competition data** immediately
2. **Join official Discord** for community support
3. **Study top public notebooks** for insights

## üìà Evaluation Strategy

### Public vs Private Leaderboard
- **Public**: Based on public test set (visible during competition)
- **Private**: Based on private test set (final ranking)
- **Strategy**: Don't overfit to public leaderboard

### Validation Strategy
```python
# Robust validation approach
- Time-series CV with gaps (prevent data leakage)
- Multiple validation periods
- Stability-focused evaluation
- Overfitting detection
```

## üö® Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

2. **Runtime Exceeded**: Conservative model parameters
3. **Overfitting**: Robust validation and regularization
4. **Reproducibility**: Complete documentation and code

### Competition Risks
1. **Late Submission**: Submit early and iterate
2. **Rule Violations**: Review rules carefully
3. **Team Issues**: Clear communication and agreements
4. **External Dependencies**: Avoid expensive external data/tools
